##Sort My Stuff (SMS)

##About the project
Sort My Stuff (SMS) allows the user to select a folder to recursively index information about. In addition to displaying metadata about each file/directory in the folder, SMS also generates a description of each file/directory based on the content and context of the file, effectively streamlining the user's file system analysis process. Additionally, SMS implements a smart searching feature to quickly and elegantly find a file based off of a human-friendly prompt as well as provide for common filters such as file extensions.

##Source of Inspiration 
Every year, ~24,000 reports of on-campus crimes are reported and investigators often face the daunting task of analyzing vast amounts of data on confiscated devices, such as phones, laptops, and tablets. Current methods are labor-intensive, requiring significant time and resources to manually search for evidence and we wanted to make something that can drastically reduce the time searching through files by combining AI and robust search functionality. This tool transforms a previously manual and time-consuming task into a streamlined, tech-driven process.

##Importance
SMS allows users to find files in a significantly shorter time which allows users to sort files more efficiently and effevtively. 

##Future Works
A few things we want to implement in the future are speech-to-text searching, adding more advanced search, and making it both multi-modal and multilingual. We want our software to be applicable in a wider range of situations while also making it more accessible.
